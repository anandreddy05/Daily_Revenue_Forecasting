# Daily Revenue Forecasting

## Overview

This project analyzes seasonal trends and patterns in sales data using time series analysis techniques.

## Key Insights

- **Yearly Spikes:** Significant peaks at the end of each year (possibly due to holidays).
- **Trend Analysis:** The data shows an upward trend before stabilizing.
- **Seasonality:** Clear repetitive cycles, especially in November.
- **Quarterly Trends:** Q3 and Q4 show higher activity.
- **ADF:** Used Augumaented Dicky Fuller Test to check Stationarity
- **Differencing:** Performed Differencing to make the data stationary
